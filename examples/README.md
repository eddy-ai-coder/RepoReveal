# Documentation Examples

This directory contains example documentation to demonstrate the quality and structure we aim for in RepoReveal.

## Purpose

These examples serve as:

- **Reference material** for contributors creating new documentation
- **Quality benchmarks** showing what comprehensive documentation looks like
- **Templates in action** demonstrating how to fill out the templates effectively

## Using These Examples

When creating documentation for a new repository:

1. **Review these examples** to understand the level of detail expected
2. **Note the structure** and how different sections flow together
3. **Observe the formatting** and use of diagrams, code blocks, and tables
4. **Learn from the explanations** - see how complex concepts are made clear

## Example Structure

Each example includes:
- Complete documentation set (all 4 required files)
- Real diagrams using Mermaid syntax
- Actual code examples
- Properly formatted tables and lists
- Cross-references between documents

## Examples
